      <!-- Story -->
      <section class="story">
        <p>Having said that, I recently moved into my dorm room starting as a Sophomore in college, and a friend of mine gave me his old Nintendo 64.
          I was stoked, to say the least - I could finally play all of those old games of my youth that I hadn't touched in at least a decade.
          His Nintendo 64 came with one yellow controller and a rather shoddy copy of Super Smash Brothers.</p>
        <p>I decided to drive around a few neighborhoods about twenty minutes or so off campus, hitting up the local garage sales, hoping to score
          on some good deals from ignorant parents. I ended up picking up a copy of Pokemon Stadium, Goldeneye, F-Zero, and two other 
          controllers for two dollars.</p>

            class="scare"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>Satisfied, I began to drive out of the neighborhood when one last house caught my attention. I still have no idea why it did; there were
          no cars there and only one table was set up with random junk on it, but something sort of drew me there. I got out of the car and was greeted by an old man.
          His outward appearance was, for lack of a better word, displeasing. After a few short and awkward glances at eachother he went to his garage and handed me a
          Nintendo 64 cartridge. It was the standard grey color, except that someone had written "Majora" on it in black permanent marker. There was a chance I could've been wrong, 
          but I had a feeling this old man just handed me a copy of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i>. I asked him how much he wanted for it. The old man smiled at me and told me that
          I could have it for free, that it used to belong to a kid who was about my age that didn't live here anymore. There was something weird about how he phrased that,
          but I didn't really pay any attention to it. I was too caught up in not only finding this game, but getting it for free. As I was leaving I heard him say "goodbye" 
          followed by an unintelligable mumble.
        <p>After a successful game hunt and a rather odd interaction with an old man, I was finally home and ready to try one of the games. Obviously, I started with <i>Majora's Mask</i> 
          Out of curiosity, I looked at the save file. Eyeballing it, I could tell that he was pretty far into the game - he had almost all of the masks and 3/4 of the bosses' remains. 
          I noticed that he had used an owl statue to save his game. He was on Day 3 and by the Stone Tower Temple, with hardly an hour left before the moon would crash. 
          I remember thinking that it was a shame that he had come so close to beating the game but never finished it.</p>
        <p>What I thought to be a normal save file turned out to be something much more <b>sinister</b></p>
