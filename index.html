      <!-- Story -->
      <section class="story">
        <p>I was in my sophomore year of college when I visited this local game store with some of my friends. The Moment I entered the shoddy building,
          I was flooded with overwhelming rush of nostalgia as I was greated with rows upon rows of old Nintendo games, from the NES all the way to the Switch. 
          I never grew up with an Nintendo 64, but something about that row of games called to me. I wasn't particularly interested in buying anything untill I saw 
          a blank cartrige with nothing but the name "Majora" crappily written across in in permanent marker. My friends and I thought it was funny at first, but apparently we 
          had unknowingly struck gold when the owner of the store mentioned how he were trying to get rid of it. Using our ever impressive common sense skills we obviously knew 
          it was a copy of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i>, but as to why this game shop owner was trying to get rid of it was baffling to say the least due to it's aftermarket prices. 
          One of my buddies had an N64 and said he could let me borrow it to play since I've never played it before. So I bought the copy for dirt cheap, stopped by my friend's house to 
          borrow his N64, and went home</p>

        <p>I've heard this game had a reputation for being a little eerie</p>
